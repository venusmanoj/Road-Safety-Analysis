Road Safety Analysis using Power BI

This project presents a comprehensive data visualization and analysis of road accidents using Power BI. It is designed to identify patterns, understand key risk factors, and explore actionable insights to reduce road accidents.

Through a series of interactive dashboards, we analyze various aspects such as accident severity, location, time, vehicle involvement, and suggest preventive strategies.


Key Insights / Summary

Dashboard 1: State-wise Road Accidents Overview
- Identified states with the highest and lowest accident rates.
- Highlighted top accident-prone states like Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra.
- Showed comparison between total accidents, deaths, and injuries state-wise.

Dashboard 2: Vehicle and Accident Type Analysis
- Showed accident distribution by vehicle type (e.g., two-wheelers, trucks).
- Found that two-wheelers are involved in the majority of fatal accidents.
- Analyzed accident nature: head-on collisions and rear-end crashes dominate.

Dashboard 3: Time-Based and Regional Accident Patterns
- Peak accidents observed in evenings and weekends.
- North and South zones report higher accident frequency.
- Suggested attention to highway safety in those regions.

Dashboard 4: Prevention Strategies & Suggestions
- Emphasized speed management, helmet/seatbelt usage, and traffic education.
- Advocated road design improvements, CCTV surveillance, and drunk driving control.
- Recommended regional action plans and community awareness programs.
